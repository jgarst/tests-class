This class covers the basics of testing with [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).  Why testing is a good idea, how to find tests, and how to use tests as documentation.  The first half of the class is a fast tour of these ideas and tools, and the second is a group exercise using the [gilded rose kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).
